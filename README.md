# Erratum

Bane - Remove any badge that increases bane; it will not apply the negative badge if the 
damage reaches the bane value. Example: In case of bane injury, 2 + 1 from chainmail, 
totaling 3 with 2 of damage. If the chainmail is removed, Bane Injury becomes 2 and the 
damage is 2, but the negative badge will not be applied. Apply the negative badge only 
at the instant the damage is suffered.
